The Sign Up Cube: Organize Your Volunteers --

Inspired by my volunteer work with a Boston-based, food rescue organization --The Sign Up Cube allows 1) volunteer coordinators to create sign-up sheets, 2) customize time slots, 3) publish public sign-up sheets, and 4) volunteers to sign-up for opportunities.  This full-stack app fosters communication and transparency among coordinators and volunteers.

### How It's Made:

This full-stack application is created using:
Client-side: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and Embedded JavaScript templates to dynamically render content.
Server-side: Express on top of Node.js, and MongoDB for the database.

I am utilizing CRUD operations to interact with the server and to work with the data that is stored in MongoDB.
